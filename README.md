# TrumpProblems
## A bug tracker for Donald Trump

Trump is too outrageous for our puny mortal minds. We become numb to his repeated offenses.

So, TrumpProblems lets us:
- collaboratively list his worst issues. 
- and see which people find the most problematic.
- and make a list of most effective responses, so anyone can quickly see how they can most help.
